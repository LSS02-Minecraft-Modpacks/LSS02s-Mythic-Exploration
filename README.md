1. How I can disable a mods?

    Follow this step:
   - Click the three point near 'Play' on modpack page on launcher
   - Check the voice under "Content Management" called "Allow content management for this profile"
   - Then you can disable the client mods that you don't want (add other mods is your risks)
   - WARN: You cannot redistribute the pack as your
